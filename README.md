# Sales-Analysis-Excel

Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive Sales Analysis Dashboard using Excel as part of a university course. This project addressed common business challenges such as data overload, performance tracking, and growth analysis. By consolidating and visualizing sales data into actionable insights, I created a tool that can be directly applied to real-world business scenarios.

Key Challenges Addressed

Data Overload: Managed and consolidated large volumes of sales data across various regions, products, and periods into a single, cohesive Excel dashboard.

Data Cleaning: Utilized advanced Excel functions and formulas to clean and standardize raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This included complex tasks such as converting mixed currency values (e.g., USD to INR) and handling large datasets precisely.

Performance Tracking: Developed effective tracking and visualization methods for sales performance using pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting. This allowed for multi-dimensional analysis of sales data.

Growth Analysis & Forecasting: Integrated Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations within Excel and used forecasting functions to project future sales trends. These features enable informed decision-making and strategic planning.

Outcome
This project highlights my technical proficiency in Excel, including using advanced functions, pivot tables, and data visualization techniques. It demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into valuable business insights, making it a solid addition for my portfolio and showcasing my readiness to tackle real-world business challenges.
